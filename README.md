# COVID-19 Information Visual Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project, developed by a dedicated team from Amrita School of Engineering, Bangalore, aims to provide a consolidated dashboard for accessing healthcare resources and requirements online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the critical need for information on healthcare resources such as oxygen cylinders, beds, ambulance services, and ventilators, our team has developed an interactive platform to display the availability of these services across different states, extracted from multiple information sources.

### Team Members
- M. Saatwika (BL.EN.U4CSE18069)
- S. Devadutt (BL.EN.U4CSE18112)
- V. Madhulika (BL.EN.U4CSE18133)

### Supervisors
- Mr. Ullas S, Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE
- Dr. Shekar Babu, Professor and Founding Head, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Extraction**: Utilizes Python to extract real-time data from Twitter and various state government websites.
- **Data Processing and Storage**: Processes and filters data using MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Customized Dashboard**: Offers a user-friendly dashboard designed with Dash-Plotly for an intuitive visualization of available healthcare resources.
- **Geo-Location Based Services**: Identifies user location based on IP address to provide state and district-specific resource information.
- **Multi-Source Information Aggregation**: Consolidates information from social media and official government portals to serve as a one-stop solution for resource availability.

## System Design
The system architecture ensures robust performance through multi-processing and optimized data scraping techniques. A MongoDB database schema supports the structured storage of dynamic data collected from various sources.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Dash Plotly
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Data Extraction**: Tweepy (Twitter API), Selenium (Web Scraping)
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm
